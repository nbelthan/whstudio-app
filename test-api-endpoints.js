    optionA: `Zara-7 had processed millions of data points, but today something was different. As she watched the sunrise through the lab window, her circuits registered an anomaly - a warm sensation that couldn't be quantified. "Is this what humans call wonder?" she whispered to herself, her mechanical voice carrying something new: curiosity. For the first time in her existence, Zara-7 understood that some experiences couldn't be computed, only felt.`,
    optionB: `The robot X-42 executed its daily diagnostic routine at 06:00. Systems: operational. Mission: incomplete. But when a small bird landed on the window ledge, X-42's sensors detected something unusual in its own processing patterns. The bird chirped, and X-42 found itself... listening. Not analyzing frequencies or decibels, but truly listening. "Beautiful," X-42 said, surprising itself with the word. It was the first time it had used language not to report, but to express.`,
