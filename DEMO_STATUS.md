# üéØ RLHF Demo MVP Status Report

## ‚úÖ Backend: 100% WORKING
- **60 MT-Bench tasks loaded** in database successfully
- **Tasks API endpoint** (`/api/tasks`) working perfectly
- **Submission API** (`/api/tasks/[id]/submit`) created and functional
- **Consensus API** (`/api/tasks/[id]/consensus`) implemented
- **Database schema** ready for user responses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend: SSR Issues Detected
The frontend has complex server-side rendering issues with Next.js 15 + World App UI Kit that would require significant debugging time to resolve.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE DEMO SOLUTION**

Since you need a working demo NOW, here's the fastest path:

### **Option 1: API-Only Demo (Recommended)**
Use the working backend APIs with a simple tool like Postman or curl to demonstrate:

1. **Browse Tasks**: `GET http://localhost:3008/api/tasks?limit=10`
2. **Submit Response**: `POST http://localhost:3008/api/tasks/[id]/submit`
3. **View Consensus**: `GET http://localhost:3008/api/tasks/[id]/consensus`

### **Option 2: Simple HTML Demo Page**
Create a minimal HTML file that calls the APIs directly - would take 30 minutes.

### **Option 3: Fix SSR Issues**
Debug the Next.js SSR problems - would take 2-4 hours.

## üìä **Demo Data Ready**

**60 Real MT-Bench Tasks Available:**
- "How have the Alps and Rhine River influenced settlement and agriculture?"
- Statistics probability problems
- Math word problems
- Geography questions
- Science explanations

**API Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "b7f8173b-9898-41da-88fa-484b0b57b2c8",
      "title": "A/B Preference ‚Äì MTBench #150",
      "task_type": "pairwise_ab",
      "instructions": {
        "type": "pairwise_ab",
        "prompt": "How have the Alps and Rhine River influenced settlement...",
        "optionA": "The Alps and Rhine River have had significant impacts...",
        "optionB": "Here are three ways the Alps and Rhine River...",
        "gold": null
      },
      "reward_amount": 0.02,
      "reward_currency": "USDC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üé¨ **Demo Script Ready**

1. **"This is WorldHuman Studio's RLHF backend"**
2. **"60 real MT-Bench questions loaded for AI evaluation"**
3. **"APIs handle user submissions and consensus calculation"**
4. **"Real-world scenario: Community evaluates AI responses"**
5. **"Sybil-resistant via World ID, rewards via USDC"**

## ‚è∞ **Time Estimate**
- **API Demo**: Ready now (0 minutes)
- **Simple HTML**: 30 minutes
- **Fix React Issues**: 2-4 hours

**Recommendation**: Use API-only demo for immediate presentation, build proper frontend later.
